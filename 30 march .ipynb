    "Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods to overcome their limitations and provide a more robust and efficient method for dealing with high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional linear regression, we seek to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. \n",
    "However, when we have a large number of independent variables, the model can become overfit and generalize poorly to new data. This is known as the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, which uses L1 regularization, shrinks some of the coefficients towards zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the dimensionality of the model. However, it can lead to instability and erratic variable selection when the variables are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression, which uses L2 regularization, also shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but it doesn't perform feature selection, and all variables are retained in the model.\n",
    "It performs well when most variables are important and provides more stable estimates when variables are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression overcomes the limitations of Lasso and Ridge Regression by combining the L1 and L2 penalties. \n",
    "The objective function in Elastic Net Regression includes both the L1 and L2 penalties, and a tuning parameter, alpha, that controls the balance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The L1 penalty helps to perform feature selection and can zero out irrelevant variables, while the L2 penalty helps to stabilize the coefficients and reduce the effects of multicollinearity.\n",
    "The alpha parameter determines the tradeoff between these two penalties and can be adjusted to find the optimal balance between bias and variance."
